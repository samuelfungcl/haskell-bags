# Functional Programming (Haskell)
# Bags Assignment

## Description
This assignment was to define a polymorphic Haskell datatype <b>bag</b> to represent a collection of items and create several functions for interaction between two bags.

## Functions
1. listToBag
This function takes a list of items and returns a bag containing exactly those items and the number of occurences of the item in the list

2. bagEqals
This function takes two bags and checks if the bags are exactly the same in terms of the item and the number of occurences of that item

3. bagInsert
This function takes in an item and inserts it into the bag, and returns the resulting bag

4. bagSum
This function takes two bags and adds them up, returning the resulting bag

5. bagIntersection
This function takes two bags and returns a resulting bag, which contains the intersection of items in both bags
